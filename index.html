        <h1>About Sacred Spaces</h1>
        <p>This is a work in progress for developing web-based music works for
        playback on multiple devices. My thought is that many people have
        multiple computing devices (e.g., laptops, desktops, phones, tablets)
        that they can use to setup a Sacred Space listening environment, either
        on their own or with their friends and family.  The works are designed
        for playback on whatever devices are available: they do not have to be
        of the same type or sonic character.  Listeners may setup the devices
        however they like for their space and decide how to interact with the
        environment: to sit, walk through, walk away and listen from afar, 
        and so on. </p>

        <h1>Creating a Sacred Space</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>Load this web page on available computing devices. Devices must have
            web browsers capable of running WebAssembly and WebAudio.</li>
          <li>Load the desired Sacred Space work from the <a href="#sacredSpaces">Create a Sacred Space</a> section. 
            This will load up a separate web page that contains the audio and visuals to run for that space.</li>
          <li>Place the device in a location of your choosing. Repeat with each device.</li>
          <li>Experiment with loudness, placement, direction, and other aspects for your device.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Use the space as you desire: stay in one location, move around, move to another room and return, and so on. Each instance of a space playing on each device is dynamically created for a unique spatial experience.</p>
