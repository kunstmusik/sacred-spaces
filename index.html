      <h2>Author: Steven Yi</h2>

      <p>This is a work in progress for developing web-based music works for
      playback on multiple devices. My thought is that many people have
      multiple computing devices (e.g., laptops, desktops, phones, tablets)
      that they can use to setup a Sacred Space listening environment, either
      on their own or with their friends and family.  The works are designed
      for playback on whatever devices are available: they do not have to be
      of the same type or sonic character.  Listeners may setup the devices
      however they like for their space and decide how to interact with the
      environment: to sit, walk through, walk away and listen from afar, 
      and so on. </p>
